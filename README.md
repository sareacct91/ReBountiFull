## Overview

ReBountiFull aims to address two critical issues: food waste in restaurants and grocers and food insecurity among families in need. The platform allows restaurants and grocers to list surplus food items, and digital food banks can register to receive notifications about available food for distribution. A sophisticated matching algorithm ensures efficient and timely redistribution, minimizing food waste and supporting communities in need.

## Key Features

* Restaurant/Grocer Integration: Restaurants and Grocers can sign up and list excess food items, including prepared meals and perishable goods.
* Digital Food Bank Registration: Food banks can register to receive notifications about available surplus food and specify their acceptance criteria.
* Matching Algorithm: The platform uses a matching algorithm to pair restaurants with surplus food to nearby digital food banks that can accept those items.
* Delivery Coordination: Facilitates coordination of food pickup or delivery between restaurants and food banks, streamlining logistics.
* User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive interface for restaurants, food banks, and volunteers to navigate listings, matches, and deliveries.
* Community Engagement: Encourages community participation through volunteer opportunities for food pickup and delivery.
